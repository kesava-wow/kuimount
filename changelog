beta 09-04:
* there is now a warning in chat when old saved variables are backed up
* correctly backup character specific set on every character
* correctly reset ActiveSet to default
* improve output of dump-old
* fix lua error when deleting a set before using the set dropdown list
* remove some unused variables

beta 08-04:
* you can now specify mounts to use as ground, flying, aquatic or water
walking - there are 4 separate lists to do so. Whether or not a mount actually
fits into one of those lists is up to you; I no longer do any hard-to-maintain
or English-client-specific tooltip parsing.
* the aquatic and water walking lists are pre-filled with all of the mounts that
currently exist in those categories.
* you can specify mounts/spells with either name or spell ID
* removed legacy support (mounting with an old-style macro - you can still
mount with a /click macro)
* you can now make a theoretically-unlimited number of sets, rather than just
3. Which set is currently active is saved per character.

Your old sets should be backed up and can be viewed in chat by typing:
/mount dump-old
