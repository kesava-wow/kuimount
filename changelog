For this update you may need to open and close the config interface with `/mount o` once in order to initiliase the new lists correctly.

A blacklist no longer exists, but if you did use it previously, it should have been imported into set two.

* bump toc to 50400
* remove blacklist
* split whitelist into three seperate sets which are all saved account-wide, plus the character specific set
* "fix" options interface doesn't show the first time the slash command is used
