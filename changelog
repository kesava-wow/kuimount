* bump toc to 50400
* remove blacklist
* split whitelist into three seperate sets which are all saved account-wide, plus the character specific set
* "fix" options interface doesn't show the first time the slash command is used

The old whitelist should be imported to set one and the blacklist should be imported to set two. The character specific whitelist will be imported to the chracter specific set.
