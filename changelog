beta 15-04:
* embed kuilib, and use its DebugPopup for dump-old

beta 12-04:
* correctly update mount journal checkboxes upon searching & filtering
* sort set dropdown list alphabetically
* fix nil error when deleting sets from the mounr journal

* change mount journal buttons to checkboxes and make them look (and work) better
* add a set selector and delete set button to the mount journal

beta 11-04:
* /mount dump-old now opens an edit box from which you can copy your old sets
into the new edit boxes, rather than having to do it all manually.
* add (early) buttons to default mount journal interface to add mounts to the
ground/flying lists

beta 09-04:
* REALLY correctly backup legacy character specific set
* fix selects faction-specific mounts and profession-specific mounts which
can't currently be used
* fix selects ground-only mounts in flyable areas with a blank whitelist

* there is now a warning in chat when old saved variables are backed up
* correctly backup character specific set on every character
* correctly reset ActiveSet to default
* improve output of dump-old
* fix lua error when deleting a set before using the set dropdown list
* remove some unused variables

beta 08-04:
* you can now specify mounts to use as ground, flying, aquatic or water
walking - there are 4 separate lists to do so. Whether or not a mount actually
fits into one of those lists is up to you; I no longer do any hard-to-maintain
or English-client-specific tooltip parsing.
* the aquatic and water walking lists are pre-filled with all of the mounts that
currently exist in those categories.
* you can specify mounts/spells with either name or spell ID
* removed legacy support (mounting with an old-style macro - you can still
mount with a /click macro)
* you can now make a theoretically-unlimited number of sets, rather than just
3. Which set is currently active is saved per character.

Your old sets should be backed up and can be viewed in chat by typing:
/mount dump-old
