alpha:
* you can now specify mounts to use as ground, flying, aquatic or water
walking - there are 4 separate lists to do so. Whether or not a mount actually
fits into one of those lists is up to you; I no longer do any hard-to-maintain
or English-client-specific tooltip parsing.
* the aquatic and water walking lists are pre-filled with all of the mounts that
currently exist in those categories.
* you can specify mounts/spells with either name or spell ID
* removed legacy support (mounting with an old-style macro - you can still
mount with a /click macro)

Your old sets should be backed up and can be viewed in chat by typing:
/mount dump-old
