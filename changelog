* Running Wild (as well as any other non-companion spellbook mount, such as flight form) can now be used
* Druid forms are now cancelled when mounting
* The slash command is now obsolete. You should use the keybind option. I may be able to add a secure button which can be placed on action bars to replace the slash command, but that isn't in this release.
